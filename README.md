## Shoman Software Mentorship

Shoman was a software engineering Mentorship program that was run by a group of software engineers between 2019 - 2021. The program had a success of mentees joining tech and others acquiring internships. The program was stopped due to time commitment challenges by the mentors. We hope to revive this program shortly

### Some of the features were:

- Mentees submit applications to join the Shoman mentorship program
- Mentees track their learning on the Shoman dashboard
- Mentors manage the assigned mentees through the Shoman dashboard
